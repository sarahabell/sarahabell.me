This is me in my studio. 

The pot that I am making is having clay coils added to its thrown base. When I am happy with its form, I will wrap it before leaving it to dry slowly. In a few weeks time it will be fired in my kiln to 1000Â°C which leaves it hard but porous. This allows the liquid glaze applied to the surface to be sucked up, leaving a layer of glaze particles ready to melt in the glaze firing.

The glazes which I use on my pots have been developed by me over the last decade. They mostly consist of ground up rock and metal oxides. Because ingredients of the same name can come from different places, they can vary in actual content. Thus glaze development can be a frustrating pastime and the successes all the more exciting.
