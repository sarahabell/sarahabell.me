The pots I make are thrown on a wheel or hand-built, sometimes a combination of both.

I love to make a glaze which will move on the pot while maturing in the kiln. The difficulty is controlling the movement so that the glaze doesn't move off the pot and finish up sticking the pot to the kiln shelf!

# Washing Up

Making glazes and applying to my pots leaves a lot of washing up!

# I Love Making Mugs

# Geometric Vases

These vases were built up from pieces of rolled out stoneware clay.
The blue glaze was developed by me over many years of experimenting.

# Blue Green Vase

This tall hand built vase has some attractive green flecks in the blue glaze. 
These appear on the area which was in the hottest part of the kiln.

# Wheel Thrown Bowl

This bowl has a white glaze making a pattern over the shiny blue glaze. 
The textured brick coloured area at the base is clay from our garden. The texture comes from heating it beyond its comfort zone!
