    Hand crafted & glazed. Find out more about my ceramics...

The pots I make are thrown on a wheel or hand-built, sometimes a combination of both.

I love to make a glaze which will move on the pot while maturing in the kiln. The difficulty is controlling the movement so that the glaze doesn't move off the pot and finish up sticking the pot to the kiln shelf!

# My Kiln and I

![kiln and me](/images/My-Kiln-and-I.jpg)

I have just opened the door of my kiln to see what lies inside.
These all look pleasingly good on first impression. 
Glaze firing temperature rises slowly to 1250ยบ and takes a day to cool down again.
Patience is required and disappointments are frequent!

# Geometric Vases

These vases were built up from pieces of rolled out stoneware clay.
The glaze was developed by me in my ceramic studio.

# Blue Green Vase

This tall hand built vase has a studio developed blue glaze which has some attractive green flecks. These appear on the area which was in the hottest part of the kiln - 1250ยบ. 

# Wheel Thrown Bowl

This wheel thrown bowl has a white glaze making a pattern over the shiny blue glaze. The textured brick coloured area at the base is clay from our garden. The texture comes from heating it beyond its comfort zone!
