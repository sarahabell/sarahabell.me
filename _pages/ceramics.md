The pots I make are thrown on a wheel or hand-built, sometimes a combination of both.

I love to make a glaze which will move on the pot while maturing in the kiln. The difficulty is controlling the movement so that the glaze doesn't move off the pot and finish up sticking the pot to the kiln shelf!

# Geometric Vases

These vases were built up from pieces of rolled out stoneware clay.
The glaze was developed by me in my ceramic studio.

# Blue Green Vase

This tall hand built vase has a studio developed blue glaze which has some attractive green flecks. These appear on the area which was in the hottest part of the kiln - 1250ยบ.
