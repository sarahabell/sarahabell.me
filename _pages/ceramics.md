    Hand crafted & glazed. Find out more about my ceramics...

The pots I make are thrown on a wheel or hand-built, sometimes a combination of both.

My glazes are mostly developed in my studio. Sometimes I use slip under my glazes, some of which is dug from the garden.
I love to make a glaze which will move on the pot but doesn't run off and stick the pot to the shelf. 
Opening the door once the kiln has cooled is nerve wracking!

# Opening the door

Looks good this time!

# Blue Jars

Here are three jars with my studio developed glaze.

The tactile blue glaze on these jars has some attractive green flecks.

These appear on the area which has been in the hottest part of the kiln.

# Green and Mauve Jars

These have the same smooth matte glaze but with a different colour scheme.

# Geometric Vases

Attractive Vases 

- built up from rolled out clay which is cut into small geometric pieces and joined together.

Very time consuming!

# Textured Surfaces

I aim for a tactile surface to my ceramics whether the glaze is silky matt or highly textured.

Some of these have a chocolate slip under the glazes for a bit of excitement!

# Wheel Thrown Bowl

This bowl has a white glaze making an interesting pattern over the shiny blue glaze.

# Washing Up

Making glazes and applying to my pots leaves a lot of washing up!
