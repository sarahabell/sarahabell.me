Hi, my name is **Sarah Abell**. I'm an artist based in Berkshire, UK.

For more information, or if you would like to **visit my Wokingham studio** please [email me](mailto:sarahabellme@outlook.com)

I make **ceramics** from stoneware clay and enhance them with **glazes developed in my studio**. 

I also make **jewellery** from my own **hand-crafted polymerclay beads**.

# Hi!

This is me recycling unfired clay. 

It recycles well as many times as you like - until you fire it.

# Glaze Testing

Making your own glazes involves many hours/years of testing.

Here I am making a line blend to give some idea of the result of mixing my chosen ingredients.

# Innovation

I have decorated this wheel thrown stoneware pot with coils of coloured polymer clay.

I love to try out new methods of creating things.  I shall do more of this!

# My Kiln and I

I have just opened the door of my kiln to see what lies inside.

Glaze firing temperature rises slowly to 1250ยบ and takes a day to cool down again.

Patience is required and disappointments are frequent!
