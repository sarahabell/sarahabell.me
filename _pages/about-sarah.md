Hi, my name is **Sarah Abell**. I'm an artist based in Berkshire, UK.

For more information, or if you would like to **visit my Wokingham studio** please [email me](mailto:sarahabellme@outlook.com)

I make **ceramics** from stoneware clay and enhance them with **glazes developed in my studio**. I also make **jewellery** from my own **hand-crafted polymerclay beads**.

# My Kiln and I

I have just opened the door of my kiln to see what lies inside.
Glaze firing temperature rises slowly to 1250ยบ and takes a day to cool down again.
Patience is required and disappointments are frequent!

# Cliffs

This is a picture made of polymer clay.
It appeared out of my pasta machine while I was creating a pattern for some beads.
I liked it enough to frame it and hang it in my studio. Serendipity!
