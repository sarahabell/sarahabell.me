Hi, my name is **Sarah Abell**. I'm an artist based in Berkshire, UK.

For more information, or if you would like to **visit my Wokingham studio** please [email me](mailto:sarahabellme@outlook.com)

I make **ceramics** from stoneware clay and enhance them with **glazes developed in my studio**. 

I also make **jewellery** from my own **hand-crafted polymerclay beads**.

# How it came about

After a short career as a secretary and a long career with horses I discovered the joys of clay.

My enthusiasm led me to do a three year degree course at Farnham's UCA where I became interested in developing glazes. 

Now in my own studio, my main interest is in creating ceramics decorated with my own studio developed glazes.

Making beads from polymer clay began for me as a result of attending Oxford Summer School.  

This clay comes in wonderfully bright colours, mostly unavailable to the glaze maker. The endless possibilities fascinate me.

Designing the jewellery for my beads seems like a world away from designing ceramics but equally enjoyable.

# What I do in my studio

**Recycling clay**

I like to work my waste clay quite wet but on a plaster batt. It is easy to wedge up to a usable condition.

Clay recycles well until you fire it.

**Glaze testing**

I develop my own glazes.

Making a line blend using various proportions will give an idea of how my chosen ingredients will react.

# Innovation

I have decorated this wheel thrown stoneware pot with coils of coloured polymer clay.

I love to try out new methods of creating things.

# My Kiln and I

Opening the kiln. Always an exciting moment.

Glaze firing temperature rises slowly to 1250ยบ and takes a day to cool down again.
