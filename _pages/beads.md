    I've taken my 3D design skills and applied them to making beads from polymer clay.
    These beads I make into jewellery. Find more about my beads and jewellery...

Polymer clay comes in an exciting range of colours which after kneading can be blended or manipulated into new and fascinating colours and patterns. Swirls, stripes and gradual changes in colour are but a few of the possibilities which I have experimented with so far. Beads may be made in various sizes and larger ones may be made hollow, though one of the joys of wearing this clay is its lightness.

My jewellery includes necklaces, pendants, bracelets and earrings. I use a variety of bought materials for stringing, fastenings and little beads to separate my hand made beads. I use sterling silver for all my earwires and will also use it for fastenings if requested.

Here are some selected pieces:
