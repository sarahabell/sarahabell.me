    My beads are handmade by me from polymer clay which is light and brightly coloured.
    These I then use to make unique pieces of jewellery which is fun and easy to wear, and available to purchase.

Polymer clay comes in an exciting range of colours which after kneading can be blended or manipulated into new and fascinating colours and patterns.  Having put all the colours together and rolled the clay into a sausage (cane), the fun bit is cutting it across the middle to see what the pattern looks like!
My beads are made in various sizes and shapes. The beads are baked in a domestic oven before being used as the key feature in my jewellery designs.

My jewellery includes necklaces, pendants, bracelets and earrings. I use a variety of bought materials for stringing, fastenings and little beads to separate my hand made beads. I use sterling silver for all my earwires and will also use it for fastenings if requested.

Here are some selected pieces:
